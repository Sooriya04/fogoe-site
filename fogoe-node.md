# Fogoe

A minimal CLI for initializing Node.js backend projects with **TypeScript support** and zero friction.

## Problem

Backend developers repeatedly spend time on the same setup tasks:
- Initializing projects
- Installing base dependencies
- Configuring entry points
- Creating minimal server boilerplate

Even without business logic, reaching a basic "server is alive" state requires manual work. This repetitive setup creates unnecessary friction at the start of every project.

## Solution

Fogoe generates only the essentials — a server, a single route, and a working application lifecycle. Reach a running state in seconds, with full freedom to extend or restructure as needed.

## Usage

Run Fogoe directly without installation:

```bash
npx fogoe          # Interactive initializer
npx fogoe --help   # Show available commands
```

Optionally, install globally:

```bash
npm install -g fogoe
fogoe              # Interactive initializer
fogoe init         # Initialize Git in existing project
fogoe push "msg"   # Push changes
```

Local installation is not required.

## What Fogoe Generates

Fogoe generates a working backend project with server setup and one route. The generated code is intentionally minimal and extensible, designed to reach a "server is running" state immediately. You control what happens next.

## Commands

Fogoe provides specific commands to manage your project lifecycle:

- **`fogoe`**: Launches the interactive setup wizard to scaffold a new project.
- **`fogoe init`**: Initializes a Git repository in an existing project and updates `fogoe.config.json` to enable Git features.
- **`fogoe push "<message>"`**: A shortcut to stage (`git add .`), commit (`git commit -m`), and push (`git push`) your changes to the remote repository.
- **`fogoe --help`**: Displays the usage guide and command list.

## Architecture Options

Fogoe supports two architecture patterns:

**Minimal**
- Single server entry point
- Fast startup
- No enforced structure
- Best for prototypes, microservices, or developers who prefer custom organization

**MVC**
- Controllers, routes, services, and config directories
- Still minimal, no business logic included
- Best for projects that anticipate growth or teams that prefer conventional structure

Choose based on project scope and team preferences.

## Supported Options

Fogoe supports the following options during initialization:

- **Languages:** JavaScript, TypeScript
- **Frameworks:** Express, Fastify
- **Module systems:** CommonJS, ES Modules
- **Git Integration:** Optional GitHub repository initialization

## Packages Included

| Category | Options |
|----------|---------|
| **Language** | JavaScript, TypeScript |
| **Framework** | Express, Fastify |
| **CORS** | cors, @fastify/cors |
| **Environment** | dotenv |
| **Database** | mongoose, prisma, mysql2, pg |
| **Hashing** | bcrypt, argon2 |
| **Auth** | jsonwebtoken (optional) |
| **Git** | GitHub initialization (optional) |

## Configuration Philosophy

Fogoe scaffolds projects, it does not configure full systems.

- Database, authentication, and encryption are opt-in dependencies
- Configuration is managed through environment variables (`.env`)
- No schemas, migrations, or business logic are generated
- Developers retain full control over implementation details

Fogoe provides the foundation. You build the system.

## TypeScript Support

Fogoe fully supports TypeScript with automatic configuration:

- **Automatic Type Installation:** All necessary `@types/*` packages are installed based on your selections
- **Smart tsconfig.json:** Generated with optimal settings for your module type and architecture
- **Path Aliases:** MVC projects get clean import paths (`@routes/*`, `@controllers/*`, etc.)
- **Zero Configuration:** TypeScript just works out of the box

### TypeScript Packages Automatically Installed:

- **Core:** `typescript`, `ts-node`, `tsx`, `@types/node`
- **Express:** `@types/express`, `@types/cors`
- **Fastify:** `@fastify/type-provider-typebox`
- **Databases:** `@types/pg`, `@types/mysql2` (when needed)
- **Libraries:** `@types/bcrypt`, `@types/jsonwebtoken` (when selected)

## Git Integration

Fogoe provides a state-driven Git flow to manage your repository:

- **Automatic .gitignore:** Configured with `node_modules/` and `.env`
- **Initial Commit:** All project files committed automatically
- **GitHub Push:** Connects to your repository and pushes the first commit
- **State Validation:** `fogoe push` validates the Git state from `fogoe.config.json` before executing.
- **Initialization Shortcut:** `fogoe init` handles both repository setup and configuration state updates.

### Git Setup Flow:

1. Select "yes" when prompted "Initialize Git repository?" during setup (or run `fogoe init` later).
2. Enter branch name (default: `main`)
3. Provide your GitHub repository URL
4. Fogoe handles the rest: init → add → commit → push
5. Use `fogoe push "your message"` for all subsequent updates.

## Non-goals

Fogoe intentionally does not:

- Generate business logic
- Enforce framework lock-in
- Create database schemas or migrations
- Make assumptions about production deployment
- Impose opinionated architecture beyond initialization
